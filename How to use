Make a new folder and name it whatever you want 
In that folder , make a new .txt document
Copy the code into the .txt document
Make sure you change the (yourpasswordhere) in the code to the password you want to use
Save
Edit there name of the .txt document to .bat (for example if the document name was file.txt rename it to file.bat
Double click the file
(Now you should see a file that just got created called *private* )
Move all the stuff you want to hide and secure with a password 
After you finish , double click the file.bat 
Type : yes
*Now the file called (private) is hidden and secured*
To show the file , double click file.bat
Enter your password 
And just like that you will see thet *private* file with all your stuff in it
PS: if the password is wrong the file wont show up
